"""Canonical promotions of high-value legacy commands.

The v12 split-brain seam: the canonical ``sndr`` CLI (``sndr.cli.main``)
shipped ~7 commands, while the ~40 commands with the real operator
functionality lived only on the legacy ``genesis`` entry point
(``sndr.cli.legacy``) and the ``sndr.compat.cli`` bridge.

This module promotes the high-value subset to the canonical surface
**by wiring, not rewriting**: each promoted command is a thin
:class:`~sndr.cli.commands.Command` that re-dispatches to the existing
legacy implementation with the original argv tail. The legacy code path
stays the single source of truth, so behavior cannot drift between the
two entry points.

Promoted (priority order): report, doctor, preset, bench, tune, config.

Delegation targets:
  - report / preset / bench / tune / config → ``sndr.cli.legacy:cli_main``
    (these are *native* legacy subcommands with ``add_argparser`` factories).
  - doctor → ``sndr.compat.cli:main`` (doctor is a *bridged* subcommand on
    the legacy tree, so we delegate to the same bridge target directly).

Each promoted command:
  - declares ``add_help = False`` so ``sndr <cmd> --help`` falls through to
    the delegate's own ``--help`` (verbatim, no stub duplication);
  - captures the argv tail via ``argparse.REMAINDER``;
  - is import-light — the delegate modules are imported lazily inside
    ``execute()`` so registering these commands never pulls heavy deps.
